------------------------------------------first we need to have a node js sample app to deploy.....----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.first we need to create a pipeline in aws by codepipeline by which we integrate our git repo with aws elastic beanstalk resource to deploy 
code automatically every time changes done in  it. 

2.in this process we need to authenticate github with elasticbeanstalk in successive process. 

3.in the last stage of pipeline we need to define our elastic beanstock  (project name) and (env name). 

4.so we need to create first our elastic beanstalk project configuration.and copy project name and env from there and paste it to pipeline then run pipeline.

5.pipeline will be created and setup code in the elasticbean environment and it will be checked by ip of instance deployed or by meanse or elasticbean url.............
